Elis died on Earth during the Fall, but a backup of her mind was transmitted off-world. She spent several years as an infugee in cold storage in the Jovian Republic before being revived and re-sleeved in a cheap synthetic morph, the cost of which she had to pay off by helping to build new habitats. Desperate to escape her situation, Elis volunteered to the Gatekeeper Corp and was selected to be a gatecrasher. She survived three missions, one of which brought her into contact with the relics of a long-dead alien race, which resulted into her being recruited into Firewall. After retiring from gatecrashing, Elis found a berth aboard the Ecstatic Metamorphosis and immersed herself in Scum culture, trading her tech service skills for her wants and needs.
Roleplaying Tips: Elis has a multifaceted personality. She can take hardship like a pro, and is more than willing to let her hair down and party away when she gets a breather. She likes to get dressed up and glam herself out with exotic bodytints, nanotats, piercings, and other body mods, but she’s also willing to spend all day taking apart an air compressor with grease up to her elbows. She’s a flagrant abuser of social networks.
